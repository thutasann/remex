# Contributing to Remex

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Remex as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/thutasann/remex.git

# Install dependencies
cd remex
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Build the package
npm run build
```
