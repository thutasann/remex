# Planning

## Phase 1: Core Architecture

1. Core Module

- Memory tracking system to monitor heap usage
- Performance metrics collection (render times, component updates)
- Heap snapshot generation and analysis
- Integration with React's lifecycle and reconciliation process
- Profiler Components
- Memory profiler to track memory allocation and leaks
- Render profiler to monitor component render frequency and duration
- Heap snapshot analyzer to identify memory-intensive components
- Hooks API
- Custom hooks for memory monitoring in functional components
- Render counter hooks to track re-renders
- Component metrics hooks for performance data
- Utilities
- Memory size calculation tools
- Performance metrics aggregation
- Data serialization for export/import
- Browser-specific memory APIs integration

## Phase 2: DevTools Extension

1. Panel UI

- Memory usage visualization (charts, graphs)
- Component render tree with performance metrics
- Heap snapshot comparison tools
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- Communication Layer
- Bridge between React application and DevTools
- Secure data transfer protocol
- Event system for real-time updates

## Implementation Strategy

- Start with core memory and performance tracking APIs
- Build React integration layer (HOCs, context providers)
- Develop custom hooks for easy developer usage
- Create utilities for data analysis and visualization
- Implement browser-specific memory monitoring
- Design extensible plugin system for future features
- This architecture provides a solid foundation that's both modular and extensible, allowing for enterprise-level development while maintaining a clean API for developers to use.
